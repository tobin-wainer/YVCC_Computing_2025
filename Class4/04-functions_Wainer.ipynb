    "The magnitude system in astronomy derives from a system devised by ancient Greeks (Hipparcus, in particular), who catalogued the brightnesses of stars visually with their eyes. The magnitude system, like the Richter scale for earthquakes or the decibel scale for sound, is a *logarithmic* scale that measures the brightness of astronomical objects. Because of this strange convention, the smaller the value is in magnitude, the brighter an object is: e.g., a -1.5 magnitude star is brighter than a +2 magnitude star. An increase in magnitude by 2.5 means an object is a factor of 10 dimmer.\n",

    "Flux (W/m$^2$, or power per unit area) is a unit of measurement you're familiar with for measuring the brightness of objects; the solar flux, or how bright the sun is at Earth's distance, is 1377 W/m$^2$. \n",
